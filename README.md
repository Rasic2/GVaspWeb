## About GVaspWeb

The Web version of [GVasp](https://github.com/Rasic2/gvasp) created by Vue and Flask, which can involve in many kinds of
tasks as below:

- plot optimization process
- plot electrostatic potential
- plot band structure
- plot density of states
- plot energy barrier

More detailed information about GVasp can see [here](https://qvasp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Install

### Create Environment

Before install the `GVaspWeb`, we strongly recommend you to
install [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
before.

After install conda, create a new environment, e.g. `gvasp-web`, and install a `python (version=3.9)`, using following
command:

```
conda create -n gvasp-web python=3.9
```

### Install GVasp

1. Use conda (recommend)

   We now made a conda package (production process can
   see [here](https://codenote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package.html#conda-package)) and uploaded to
   the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/hui_zhou/gvasp), so you can also install `GVasp` from it:

   ```
   conda install -c hui_zhou -c conda-forge gvasp
   ```

2. Use PyPi

   We have made the wheel (production process can
   see [here](https://codenote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package.html#pypi-wheel)) and upload to
   the [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/gvasp/),
   you can also install from it:

   ```
   python -m pip install gvasp
   ```

   If the download speed is too slow, we suggest you change the pip mirror by modifying the `~/.pip/pip.conf` file.

If you run the `gvasp -v` and print version information, then you install the `GVasp` successful ~~

```
GVasp version x.x.x (Linux-5.10.16.3-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35)
```
